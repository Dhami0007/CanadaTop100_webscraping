      "        When editor Richard Yerema was working on the first edition of Canada's Top 100 Employers 25 years ago, he recalls a recurring thought passing through his mind. \"I remember talking about how one day there'll be four-day work weeks,\" he says. \"In fact, I remember even earlier, in high school geography, talking about how this will come.\"\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <p>\n",
      "        Well, we're still not quite there yet, even as now-executive editor Yerema and his colleagues at Mediacorp, which runs the annual competition, celebrate the Top 100's quarter-century anniversary. But it's fair to say that vacation and time-off policies, always closely watched by job-seekers, have improved dramatically since the year 2000.\n",
      "       </p>\n",
      "       <div class=\"togglable-text\" id=\"togglable-feature-1\">\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         \"We've looked back at the data,\" says Yerema, \"and in 2000 a starting vacation allowance of four weeks was offered by just eight per cent of the employers. It was a very small sliver, and mostly restricted to software and tech companies. Three weeks was the norm and a major chunk of the employer applicant pool gave people just two weeks to start.\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         Today, you can almost turn around the figures. Fully 31 per cent of this year's winners provide at least four weeks to start, and a mere seven per cent are still hanging back at two weeks. Moreover, notes senior editor Kristina Leung, \"it's four-plus weeks. Some companies offer a lump sum of, say, 25 working days that can be used flexibly. And a few are moving to 'unlimited' time off, saying 'we're not putting any sort of parameters on how you use this time.'\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         What has driven the change? For one thing, the unchangeable. \"Time is limited for all of us,\" says Yerema. \"It's one of the most important variables that an organization can offer and that people will value. Many employers compete on vacation time.\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         He notes that Canada's Top 100 Employers itself has been influential in offering transparency to the process. He remembers when one of Canada's largest employers learned through the competition that others were moving from two weeks to three and it had to match them. \"Once you shine a light on it, the idea that two weeks was acceptable to recruit new talent or compete just couldn't hold, and you might need to up your offering.\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         As you might imagine, the biggest turning point came at the start of this decade, sparked by the lockdowns for the pandemic. \"There was a notable shift coming out of the pandemic, in the sense of folks feeling like they lost time,\" says Leung. \"They were realizing the value of their time, whether it's through vacation policies or hybrid work in general, because they lost so much time commuting, they lost so much time staying at home. They really wanted to reclaim that time and have a little bit more time off.\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         As it happens, that period coincided with the advent of Gen Z, born from 1997 onward, coming into the job market. \"There's quite a bit of literature that talks about Gen Z valuing time off and flexibility above financial compensation,\" notes Leung. \"So that may be driving some of the trend as employers respond to the needs of younger job seekers.\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         She notes another very modern concept - inclusion - has also had an effect. \"There's paid leave for Indigenous employees to attend cultural and spiritual events, which used to be unpaid and offered sparingly. And there are often flexible statutory holidays so you don't have to use them on the standard days, since not everyone celebrates Christmas, for example. There's been an overall expansion of 'how can we make our benefits more inclusive?'\"\n",
      "        </p>\n",
      "        <p>\n",
      "         Among Top Employers offering unlimited time off is Calgary-based Mawer Investment Management Ltd., where board chair Craig Senyk notes that people often need breaks for such issues as sickness, kid problems, stress or a death in the family. \"And they just go, because we say it all the time - take the time you need. We don't even have a vacation policy. Just take the time you need for vacation as well. People will make sure that they're covered - that's part of the responsibility and accountability that comes with that philosophy.\"\n",

      "        <p>\n",
      "         In St. John's, fraud-detection firm Nasdaq Verafin, a long-standing winner, has offered unlimited time off for years. To executive vice-president Stephanie Champion, it's essential to company strategy. \"This benefit is highly appreciated by our employees,\" she says, \"and it plays a crucial role in fuelling recruitment as we scale our business for growth.\"\n",

Yet, it's far from the former rigidity of 9-to-5. Just consider the recent past and some of the popular trends that defined how people worked.\n",

Companies scrambled to set up workers safely at home, not only with ergonomic chairs, but online yoga and virtual town halls to keep everyone connected. Barriers were broken as the CEO shared recipes from her kitchen and introduced the family's French bulldog. Then Black Lives Matter happened and businesses addressed diversity more seriously, adding structure and accountability. Employers learned to listen.\n",

For instance, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union, or Vancity, a multiple winner since 2003, offers leading-edge benefits such as mental health support up to $10,000 a year, generous maternity and parental top-ups, and a new defined benefit pension plan, designed using employee feedback and a team of pension experts.\n",

      "        <p>\n",

The bar is much higher when it comes to authenticity and transparency. People expect greater context around decision-making â including the opportunity to ask questions of senior leaders.\n",
